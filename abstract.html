    <h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
    <p>
      Our project is about how many people are affected by fraud and scam during online shopping in an area. The main motive for selecting this project is that online shopping scams have become increasingly common as more people turn to e-commerce for their purchases. Scammers use various tactics to trick shoppers into losing money and personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tried to gather information on how many people are affected by these online scams in a specific area. With this data, we aim to raise awareness among people in that region. The survey results prove that the majority of people have experienced fraud while online shopping.
