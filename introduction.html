      It is a survey about <strong>“IDENTIFICATION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED FRAUD OR SCAM DURING ONLINE SHOPPING”</strong> in an area. For this survey we selected an area called <strong>VEDAYAPALEM</strong> in Nellore District. Fraud and scam includes mishaps like increasing delivery charges, misplacing the product, not receiving the product after paying the money, and increasing the actual price of the product before delivering it.
